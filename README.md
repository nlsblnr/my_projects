# my_projects

Hello everyone!

I am a teenaged self-taught programmer who tries to get an apprenticeship at Google Switzerland.
This is my repository.

First off, I learnt programming on myself, so my code's very likely to come out as extreme garbage. 
Another thing: I'm not a native English speaker, so I apologize for any inconveniences and possible mistakes.

I usually program in Python, and I'm studying and learing casually, so I hope my programming skills equally evolving.

Feel free to contact me :)
