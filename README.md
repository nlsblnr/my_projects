# my_projects

Hello everyone!
Welcome to my repository.

I am a teenaged self-taught programmer who tries to get an apprenticeship at Google Switzerland.
(Edit: The apprenticeship-offer has been taken down before I even could submit my application. 
Anyways, I'm excited to improve my skills and hope to get any other opportunities to work in the software engineering world)

First off, I learnt programming on myself, so my code's very likely to come out as extreme garbage. 
Another thing: I'm not a native English speaker, so I apologize for any inconveniences and possible mistakes.

I usually program in Python, and I'm studying and learing casually, so I hope my programming skills will equally evolve.

Feel free to contact me :)
